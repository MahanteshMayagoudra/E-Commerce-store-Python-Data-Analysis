Project: E-Commerce Data Analysis Using SQL and Python





Cleaned and imported multiple CSV files into a MySQL database using Python

Performed data cleaning and transformation using SQL queries

Analyzed customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends

Visualized key insights using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

Some of the insights I explored:

Top-selling product categories

Monthly and yearly order trends

Percentage of installment payments

Customer retention and revenue growth over time

This project helped me improve my skills in writing complex SQL queries, working with relational data, and presenting insights clearly with Python visualizations.
